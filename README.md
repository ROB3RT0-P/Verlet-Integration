# Verlet-Integration - Realistic Cloth Physics
By Robert Parry Sep 2021 ~ May 2022

This project was written for my university dissertation, and covers the use of Unity to create Realistic Cloth Physics with C#. 
The logic behind the code comes from the paper 'Advanced Character Physics' by Thomas Jakobsen.
